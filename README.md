# MoblieNet2-SolarCell Project Overview
Graduation Project – CNN Image Classification using MobileNetV2

This project presents an image classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model is designed to achieve high accuracy while remaining lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-world and resource-constrained applications.

The system was trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using standard performance metrics. MobileNetV2 was chosen due to its balance between performance and computational efficiency. The project demonstrates the complete deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
